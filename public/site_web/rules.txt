To start the game, each player draws ten White Cards.
The person who most recently pooped begins as the Card Czar and plays a Black Card. The Card Czar reads the questions or fill-in-the-blank phrase on the black card out loud.

Everyone else answers the question or fills in the blank by passing one white card, face down, to the Card Czar.

The Card Czar shuffles all of the answers and shares each card combination with the group. For full effect, the Card Czar should usually re-read the black card before presenting each answer. The card Czar then picks the funniest play, and whoever submitted it gets one point.

After the round, a new player (clockwise) becomes the Card Czar, and everyone draws back up to ten white card. After 10 rounds, whoever has max points wins.
